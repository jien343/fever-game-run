            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The WNBA's national television deal, which took effect in 2025, distributes games across multiple networks. This is the largest media rights agreement in women's basketball history, and Indiana Fever games are featured prominently due to the team's popularity and star power.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              ION Television is the crown jewel of free WNBA coverage. As part of the league's media deal, ION carries a significant package of regular-season and playoff games. Because ION is a free over-the-air broadcast network, all you need is a digital antenna to watch. No cable subscription, no streaming login, no monthly fee. For cord-cutters and budget-conscious fans, this is the best option. ION is available in over 100 U.S. markets and reaches approximately 120 million households.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              ESPN continues to carry a significant portion of the WNBA schedule, including marquee matchups, Friday night doubleheaders, and playoff games. ABC features select Sunday afternoon games during the regular season and key playoff rounds. Access requires a cable or satellite subscription, or a live TV streaming service such as YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, or Sling TV. All ESPN-broadcast games are also available through the ESPN app with authentication.

              Amazon Prime Video carries games from the TNT Sports package as part of the WNBA media deal. These games are available to Amazon Prime subscribers at no additional cost beyond the standard Prime membership. For fans who do not yet have Prime, Amazon typically offers a 30-day free trial, which can be a cost-effective way to sample the coverage during the season. Prime Video delivers games in high definition with alternate camera angles and real-time statistics overlays.

            </div>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Regional blackouts are the most common source of frustration for WNBA fans using League Pass. If you live within the Indiana Fever's designated broadcast territory — which covers most of Indiana and parts of surrounding states — games that are broadcast on the local regional sports network will be blacked out on WNBA League Pass.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The good news is that nationally broadcast games on ION, ESPN, ABC, and Prime Video are never subject to regional blackouts. If you are an in-market fan, your best strategy is to combine a digital antenna for ION games with a cable, satellite, or live TV streaming subscription that includes ESPN and your local RSN.

              <p className="text-yellow-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                If you are in the Fever broadcast territory and want to use League Pass, all blacked-out games become available as full replays approximately three hours after the final buzzer. For live viewing, use ION (free antenna), ESPN (cable/streaming login), or Prime Video for nationally broadcast matchups.
